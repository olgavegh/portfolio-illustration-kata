# Project Spec: Kata Portfolio Website

## Objective

Build a minimalist, artwork-first portfolio website for an illustrator.

The homepage focuses on visual exploration using a masonry grid of artworks.
Projects exist as secondary narrative layers that users can choose to open.

The system must support:

- CMS-driven content via Supabase
- instant content updates (no redeploy)
- clean, professional, minimal design
- scalable frontend architecture

This is a production-grade portfolio, not an experiment.

---

## Design Direction (FIXED)

The design direction is already defined another md file and must NOT be changed.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React (Vite)
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend / CMS

- Supabase (database + auth)
- No custom backend
- No admin panel inside the site

### Hosting

- GitHub (source control)
- Vercel (deployment)

---

## Data Flow (IMPORTANT)

- Homepage loads published artworks only
- Filtering is done by artwork.category
- Clicking artwork opens fullscreen overlay
- Overlay supports horizontal scrolling between artworks
- “View project” navigates to project detail page
- Project page loads project + its artworks
- Content updates appear instantly (no redeploy)

---

## Security & Access

- Public frontend uses Supabase anon key
- RLS enforces published-only visibility
- No secrets exposed
- No write access from frontend
- Content edited only via Supabase Studio

---

## Commands

- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`

---

## Project Structure (recommended)

- `src/`
  - `components/`
  - `pages/`
  - `layouts/`
  - `hooks/`
  - `services/` (Supabase queries)
  - `styles/`
- `docs/`
- `public/`

---

## Boundaries

### ✅ Always

- Respect the defined CMS structure
- Keep design minimal
- Prioritize artworks over UI
- Follow existing data flow
- Keep components small and readable

### ⚠️ Ask before

- Changing data schemas
- Introducing new libraries
- Adding authentication flows
- Changing navigation structure
- Modifying CMS logic

### 🚫 Never

- Change CMS architecture
- Introduce admin panel UI
- Hardcode content
- Commit environment variables
- Alter design direction
- Replace masonry or overlay concept

---

## Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when:

- artworks load correctly from Supabase
- homepage exploration works smoothly
- fullscreen overlay works on desktop and mobile
- project pages render correctly
- Kata can update content without developer help

Polish, animations, and enhancements come after MVP stability.

## Database Ownership Strategy

### During Development (Now)

- Developer creates Supabase project under their own account
- Project: `portfolio-illustration-kata`
- Developer has full admin access for building and testing

### After Project Delivery (Later)

1. Customer creates her own Supabase account
2. KatCustomera creates her organization (e.g., `kata-studio`)
3. Developer transfers the project to Kata's organization
4. Kata becomes sole owner
5. Developer access is removed

### Why This Approach?

- **For development:** Fast iteration, full control, easy testing
- **For client:** Full ownership of data, no dependency on developer
- **Professional:** Clear handover process, client independence

### Transfer Process

1. Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → General
2. "Transfer Project" → Select Kata's organization
3. Confirm transfer
4. Kata verifies access, developer loses access

> **Note:** A detailed customer guide for Supabase usage will be created separately.
